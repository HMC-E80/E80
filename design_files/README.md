# E80 Hardware Design Files

This directory contains the hardware design files for the E80 robot platform, including PCB schematics, layouts, and gerber files.

## Directory Structure

- **adapter_board/** - Design files for the Teensy 4.0 to 3.2 adapter board
  - KiCad project files and custom component libraries

- **motherboard/** - Design files for the main E80 Motherboard (MTB)
  - Schematics, PCB layouts, and documentation
  - Contains MTB_V3.0.2021 with complete KiCad project files

- **protoboard/** - Design files for the prototyping board (PTB)
  - Includes KiCad project files and gerber files for manufacturing

## Usage

These design files are provided for reference and can be viewed or modified using KiCad 5.0 or later. The gerber files in the PTB_V2_Gerbers directory can be sent directly to PCB manufacturers for reproduction.

## Documentation

Schematic PDFs are provided for the motherboard in the motherboard directory for easy reference without needing to open KiCad.
