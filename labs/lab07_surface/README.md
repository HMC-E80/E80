# Lab 7: Surface Controller

This lab implements the surface control system for the underwater robot, allowing it to navigate to GPS waypoints.

## Objectives

- Process GPS data to determine current position
- Implement waypoint navigation algorithm
- Control surface motors for steering and propulsion
- Log navigation data for performance analysis

## File Description

- `lab07_surface.ino` - Main Arduino sketch for the surface controller
