# Lab 7: Dive Controller

This lab implements the dive control system for the underwater robot, allowing it to maintain a specific depth.

## Objectives

- Implement PID control for depth regulation
- Process pressure sensor data to determine current depth
- Control dive motors to maintain target depth
- Log performance data for analysis

## File Description

- `lab07_dive.ino` - Main Arduino sketch for the dive controller
