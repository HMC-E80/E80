# E80

This repository includes Arduino sketches (.ino) for the Teensy on the E80 motherboard.
The files for each lab are included in a separate folder.
The .ino files in each lab folder share the same name as the folder (e.g., `E80_Lab_01.ino` is in a folder named `E80_Lab_01.ino`).
This is a requirement for the Arduino IDE.

This respository also includes a [folder](./libraries/) of all the libraries you need for the various hardware peripherals on your motherboard (e.g., the GPS, and intertial measurement unit (IMU)).

The [MATLAB](./MATLAB/) folder contains the various MATLAB `.m` files which are used throughout the project for data anlysis and other functions.
